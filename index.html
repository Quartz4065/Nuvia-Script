                <p>“I see here on the form that you are struggling with your (diet/ ability to chew.) Can you expand on :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“How is this affecting your ability to chew?”</li>
                    <li>“Which foods are you having to avoid?”</li>
                    <li>“So how are you chewing then?”</li>

                <p>Diet Value Statement:</p>
                <p>“Chewing is the start of our digestive system and when you can’t chew right you aren’t able to eat as healthy or digest properly. In the consultation we’ll give you more information on how our permanent teeth in 24 Hours will get you back to eating the foods you want.”</p>

                <p>Pain Value Statement:</p>
                <p>“Pain is an indicator of infection in the mouth. In your consultation they’ll take a 3D x-ray and they’ll be able to see the amount of infection that is present and we can talk to you about treatment options”</p>
                <h4>Confidence Script</h4>
                <p>“I see here on the form that you are experiencing a lack of confidence in your smile. Can you expand on that?”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“How is it affecting you socially?”</li>

                <p>Confidence Value Statement:</p>
                <p>“I don’t know if you’ve seen our videos online but you can see how much people’s confidence changes literally overnight. In the consultation they’ll actually show you a digital mockup of what your smile could look like in 24 hours”</p>
                <h4>Label Summary</h4>
                <p>“So it sounds like you [INSERT WHY]. Is that right?”</p>
                <p>“Dental implants are a permanent solution and can restore the function of your teeth. From what we have discussed I believe our permanent teeth in 24-Hours will be the best solution for you.”</p>
                <h3>Scheduling</h3>
                <p>“The first step is to come in for a consultation here in (location). The consultation really serves as a discovery period where we can take CT-Scans get you a treatment plan and answer any questions you might have.</p>
                <p>Do mornings or Afternoons work better for you?” * get them in within 48 hour</p>
                <p>“Awesome we just had ______ or ______ open up. Which works best?”</p>
                <h3>Deposit and Close</h3>
                <p>“When we schedule an appointment we reserve the entire office and staffs time for a whole hour so it’s important that you show up for your appointment. For that reason we do ask you to reserve your appointment with an $89 deposit which is refunded back to you when you come in for your appointment. Would you like to do that with a debit or credit card?”</p>
                <p>Get $89</p>
                <p>“I’ll send you an appointment confirmation and receipt. We’re excited to see you!”</p>
                <h3>Voucher</h3>
                <p>Goal: To make sure they understand that to qualify for the 10% discount they can’t reschedule or not show up to their first appointment. Ultimately we want them to show up for their appointment</p>
                <p>“As you can imagine we have had an overwhelming response to this voucher with how many people we have trying to come in we are unable to accommodate reschedules and no shows. For that reason to qualify for that one time 10% discount you must show up to your consultation on {date and time} without rescheduling.”****This is our win marker for Balto so make sure to say this after every set</p>
                <h3>Spoucher</h3>
                <p>Goal: To make sure that if there is a spouse or significant other involved in the decision making process they show up and will receive a $100.</p>
                <p>“Oh hey! ……Last thing……. the doctor does ask that if you have a spouse or significant other that they attend the consultation with you so we do offer a $100 gift card for bringing them with you to this appointment. Who should we put in the notes that will be coming with you on __________?”</p>
